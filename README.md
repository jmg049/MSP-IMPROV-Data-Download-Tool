# MSP-IMPROV Data Download Tool

A simple CLI tool for downloading the MSP-IMPROV data set. You must have completed the license agreement for the data set and have permission to use it. The tool requires that you provide the password assigned to you for accessing the MSP-IMPROV data set. 

After downloading the data, the tool performs some clean up of the folder.

```python
python get_data.py 
```

## In Future
1. Extend to include unzipping of the data set.
2. Extend to include pre-processing and feature extraction.
